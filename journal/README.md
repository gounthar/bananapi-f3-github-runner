# Session Journal

This directory contains detailed technical articles automatically generated by the session-journalist agent at the end of each work session.

## What's Here

Each file represents a complete work session documenting the procedures, commands, challenges, and solutions encountered during the Banana Pi F3 GitHub runner setup.

Articles are written in **AsciiDoc format** and are suitable for direct blog publication.

## File Naming Convention

`session_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.adoc`

Example: `session_2025-11-30_1630.adoc`

## How Session Documentation Works

1. At the end of each work session, when you say "goodbye" or "done"
2. The **session-journalist agent** is automatically invoked
3. It reads the conversation history and `.claude/CONTEXT.md`
4. Extracts technical procedures, commands, and solutions
5. Generates a comprehensive article (1500-3000 words)
6. Saves to this directory in AsciiDoc format
7. Uses the **style-replicator agent** for authentic technical voice

## Article Structure

Each session article typically includes:

- **Introduction**: What was accomplished in the session
- **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge or setup
- **Step-by-Step Procedures**: Detailed walkthrough with commands
- **Code Examples**: Actual commands and outputs
- **Troubleshooting**: Issues encountered and solutions
- **Key Takeaways**: Important lessons learned
- **Next Steps**: What comes next in the journey

## Using These Articles

These articles are designed to be:

- **Republishable**: Ready for blog/documentation sites
- **Self-contained**: Each article stands alone
- **Detailed**: Includes all necessary context and commands
- **Authentic**: Written in natural technical voice, not AI-polished

## Converting to Other Formats

AsciiDoc can be converted to various formats:

```bash
# Convert to HTML
asciidoctor session_*.adoc

# Convert to PDF (requires asciidoctor-pdf)
asciidoctor-pdf session_*.adoc

# Convert to Markdown (requires pandoc)
pandoc -f asciidoc -t markdown session_*.adoc -o output.md
```

## Integration with Main Documentation

Session articles complement the structured guides in `docs/hardware/`:

- **docs/hardware/**: Step-by-step guides (what to do)
- **journal/**: Session articles (how it was done, with context)

Both are valuable - guides for following, articles for understanding.
